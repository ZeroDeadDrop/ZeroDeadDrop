ZeroDeadDrop Security Policy

Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security issue, please report it privately via email:  
ZeroDeadDrop@gmail.com



Do not open public issues with security details. Provide:

* Description of the vulnerability
* Steps to reproduce
* Affected version(s)
* Optional proof-of-concept (without exposing sensitive data)



Response Process

* Acknowledgement within 7 business days
* Assessment of severity
* Patch release if applicable
* Private communication until the issue is resolved



Supported Browsers

* Chrome ≥88
* Firefox ≥85
* Edge ≥88
* Safari ≥14
* Tor Browser Standard/Safer (not Safest mode; JavaScript required)



Security Considerations

* ZeroDeadDrop is fully offline; all operations occur in the browser.
* All encryption uses AES-256-GCM with PBKDF2-SHA256 key derivation.
* Random salts and IVs are generated per encryption chunk.
* Session data is ephemeral; closing or reloading the page erases all memory.
* The software cannot protect data once it leaves memory; users are responsible for secure storage of encrypted bundles.



Data Retention \& Legal Compliance



ZeroDeadDrop does not store or collect any user content, encryption keys, or identifying information. ZeroDeadDrop cannot decrypt, recover, or reconstruct deleted messages.



If ZeroDead ever receive a lawful request or court order, our response is simple: No retrievable data exists on our systems, because ZeroDeadDrop operates without servers or databases.



Users are responsible for the security of their own devices. Any possibility of forensic recovery depends on that device’s hardware and security settings — not on ZeroDeadDrop.



Most security issues come from human error, not from the technology itself. Always:



\- Delete the bundle or manifest after use.

\- Ensure your recipient does the same.

\- Avoid storing decrypted files in insecure locations.

\- Use strong, unique passwords — weak passcodes make brute-force attacks easier over time.



Any file downloaded or copied from ZeroDeadDrop is the USER'S responsibility to store or delete securely.



While AES-256-GCM encryption has never been broken in practice, \*\*no encryption is immune to misuse\*\*. Security depends on correct use and strong passwords.
